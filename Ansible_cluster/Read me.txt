To set up an Ansible cluster with three nodes and perform the specified tasks, you need to write an 
Ansible playbook and configure your inventory file. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Install Ansible on the control node: Ensure Ansible is installed on your control node (master node). 
You can install Ansible using the following command:
"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get install ansible -y "

for authentication of all nodes see "Auth" file

Configure the inventory file: Create an inventory file that lists your nodes(see config.txt file for sytax). 
This file typically resides at "/etc/ansible/hosts" or can be a separate file in your working directory.

Playbook file to create ansible cluster is saved as "setup_cluster.yml"
run the playbook using the following command
" ansible-playbook -i inventory setup_cluster.yml "
